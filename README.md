# AboutMeee
I am grade 10 student in WCI, and
I like playing video games and sport.    
I play rugby and my number is 2. Rugby is one of my favorite sports and I am really having fun when I am playing it. 
In the other hand video games are fun too. When I am bored I play video games and daymm really fun. 
School is fun hanging out with friends and talking. 
WCI is really good school so I would recommend the school for newcomers to Canada like me. I came to Canada 2 years ago and now I am living my life really happy. Thanks to WCI that stresfull days went fast. 
I really liked Canada so far and I am really happy. I am hoping it will continue like that.
